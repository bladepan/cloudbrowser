Some notes on TODOs.

Would like to chizzle away at jsdom patch to reduce it to zero.

- preClickActivationHandler clearly need to go in jsdom proper

- console.log on error output - shouldn't we instead override HTMLElement.raise or HTMLDocument.raise?

- __enclosingFrame:     is this really needed? Can't .parent be used?

- browser:  - can this be made generic.

- other patches: are they really needed (like documentFeatures, shouldn't they be
    settable from outside?)

    - unload etc. - shouldn't this go in jsdom proper?



Refactor issues
- remove ugly bindings in applications 
@serveVirtualBrowserHandler = lodash.bind(@_serveVirtualBrowserHandler, this)

- change private property names

- consolidate classes : configs

- serverConfig.listApps  : every worker has full set of applications

- appConfig.listBrowsers : 

- application.closeBrowser, need to close the appInstance if needed

Permission issues

- add permission for create app : done

- add permission for create appInstance : done

- permission checking for create browser -- should put this in appinstance
